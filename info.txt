Hello! This is a work in progress C++ project meant to create a login system where a login will be
created and saved into a folder.
The current plan (subject to change) is to set the program to
    -ask the user if they would like to login or register
    -if asked to register, will save the username and password into a file
    -if asked to login, it will ask for the username and password, and then check if the information
matches the information on file. if not, print an error message and give the option to try again,
register, or to close the application.
